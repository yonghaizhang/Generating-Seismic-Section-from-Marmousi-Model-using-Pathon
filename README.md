# Generating-Seismic-Section-from-Marmousi-Model-using-Python
In this Notebook, the author presents the steps for generating simulated seismic section from Marmousi velocity and density models. The models are donloaded from:
https://wiki.seg.org/wiki/AGL_Elastic_Marmousi

One can also use the models come with this notebook.

The project is based on the online prject by [Ryan A. Mardani](https://towardsdatascience.com/generating-synthetic-seismogram-in-python-519f23f07894):
