# Generating-Seismic-Section-from-Marmousi-Model-using-Python
In this Notebook, I present the steps for generating simulated seismic section from Marmousi velocity and density models. The models are downloaded from [SEG Open Data](https://wiki.seg.org/wiki/AGL_Elastic_Marmousi). One can also use the models come along with this notebook.

This project is based on the online prject by [Ryan A. Mardani](https://towardsdatascience.com/generating-synthetic-seismogram-in-python-519f23f07894), where the author presented a notebook for generating seismogram from well logs velocity and density files.
